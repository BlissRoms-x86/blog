However, with the shocking discover that Grub2Win, a project that we and many people are using to install and dual-boot BlissOS [is doing something inappropriate](https://twitter.com/blissos_org/status/1700613048518795683) , we realized that it\u2019s time and decide to look back at our bootable installer to completely revamped it :\\n\\n\\n\\n* Both the installer and the initrd now will use latest busybox 1.36.1 built by Docker ([https://github.com/docker-library/busybox](https://github.com/docker-library/busybox))\\n* Almost all of the libraries & programs are now using prebuilts from Debian 13 i386 instead of the old one from Android-x86 (which was taken from an old version of Fedora).\\n* efivar and efibootmgr are still being built from source, but are being updated to latest versions.\\n* Grub has been bumped to Grub 2.06 for both Legacy BIOS or UEFI. Bumping Grub2 to the latest stable version also helps **fixing black screen issues when trying to install**.\\n* Support installing with exFAT or F2FS (experimental).\\n* UEFI users can now be able to manually choose the ESP (EFI System Partition) if they want, this is for people who have multiple ESP in their setup or just want to make sure that the installer picks the correct partition. We also allow users to change the label on the folder or on the UEFI entry if you want more customization.\\n* Some label and text edit for better comprehensiveness of what the installer tries to do.\\n* Support install with rEFInd for UEFI users, it is still in the experimental stage so please consider carefully before choosing it.\\n* Using rsync for the files copy stage as it can fix an annoying problem that the progress bar will reach 200% when done.\\n\\nWe believe that with these new changes, users will have a great experience setting up the OS. Just a small caution : Unlike Android-x86, we haven\u2019t planned to support Secure Boot yet so please disable it before trying to install the OS.\\n\\nCheck out the screenshot here if you are interested : https://t.me/hmdumbground/111\\n\\n\\n## An approach to OTA updates on BlissOS\\n\\nA few months ago, we reached out to [@erfanoabdi](https://github.com/erfanoabdi) for a solution to OTA updates. This was intended for Bliss Co-Labs clients and later applied to BlissOS and it is unlike any other OTA method that any Android-x86 or other derivative used to use. The idea here is utilizing virtual A/B by making a bootctrl HAL that will edit Grub configuration to switch between the two slots. The advantage is that with virtual A/B, users can still be able to use the OS while it\u2019s updating because the update is being handled in another slot. Also other custom ROMs can easily use our method as the update is being handled by LineageUpdater, which is being used by many.\\n\\nThe disadvantages that we observed is that this method does not support filesystems that are handled by [FUSE](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/next/filesystems/fuse.html) , so if you install BlissOS on an NTFS partition, you will not be able to use it. Another issue is that because switching slot is to edit a config file, manual Linux dual-boot will now have to take extra steps if you want OTA support. We will soon update it in our Documentation.\\n\\nAll versions that we are maintaining will support OTA. This includes BlissOS 14, 15 and 16. Please install the new builds to get the latest OTA updates in the future.\\n\\n\\n## AV1 support for ffmpeg codecs\\n\\nThanks to the work of [@KonstaKANG](https://konstakang.com/), we\u2019ve been able to bring AV1 support into our ffmpeg codecs. Currently AV1 is being handled by [libdav1d](https://code.videolan.org/videolan/dav1d) made by the developers at VLC and being built using [GloDroid\u2019s AOSPExt](https://github.com/GloDroid/aospext). We are also planning to support VA-API AV1 soon for hardware-accelerated solution.\\n\\n\\n## Properly handle suspend\\n\\nWhile making her first big contribution to the project which is providing fixes to the Steam Deck, our friend [@Kethen](https://github.com/Kethen) has decided to help us tackle the suspend issue. Suspending the machine or waking it up now feels less buggy than before.\\n\\n\\n## BlissOS Go for all versions\\n\\nAnnounced in June with only 15 (Android 12L) versions, BlissOS Go is still being continued to develop and now we are announcing that the Go version will be available to all BlissOS versions, including 14, 15 and 16 with both Gapps or FOSS variants.\\n\\n\\n## Bump to kernel 6.1 for all builds\\n\\nKernel 6.1 has been tested internally and is available on BlissOS 16 for a while now and we decided to finally release all of our BlissOS versions with it. Still the same combination of Google\u2019s Android common kernel source + Android-x86 patches + some xanmod patches. Now with more hardware supported especially the Steam Deck with some drivers & fixes being pulled directly from Valve.\\n\\n\\n## Introducing BlissOS Zenith\\n\\nWe realized that there are users out there who are using hardware that are too new for the kernel in BlissOS to support. This is a challenge as we know that we can\u2019t just build all the current BlissOS versions with stable or mainline kernel, that would risk the stability of the OS. So we\u2019ve decided that we will make another variant, this time with 2 key differences :\\n\\n\\n\\n* Only build the latest version of BlissOS available for this variant, so for now it\u2019s 16.\\n* Using stable branch of the linux kernel.\\n\\nWe want to make this build for users that have new hardware or the one that always wants the latest, latest version of BlissOS and the latest kernel. With that said, we still need a name for this new variant. This gave us an idea, \u201cWhat if we ask our community ?\u201d and decide to ask people to give this new build a name on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/blissos_org/status/1733872766133403666)  & our group chat. After looking through all the suggestions, we\u2019ve decided to choose `Zenith` .\\n\\n \\\\\\nBlissOS Zenith, The new flagship build of BlissOS, intended for \\"chasing the latest\\". Starting now with version 16.9.4 and kernel 6.6\\n\\n\\n## Other updates\\n\\n\\n\\n* A lot of fixes for Steam Deck, even a dedicated sensor HAL thanks to [@Kethen](https://github.com/Kethen) (again).\\n* alsa-info.sh is now being included into BlissOS, this will generate a file with all the necessary information related to audio, this is intended to debug audio issues.\\n* [sof-firmware](https://github.com/thesofproject/sof-bin) from Intel is being included to support more audio hardware.\\n* All builds are now using Mesa 23.3.3\\n* Some fixes to the sensors HAL (thanks to [@Kethen](https://github.com/Kethen) again)\\n* Fixed an issue that desktop Nvidia GPUs with nouveau can\u2019t be able to get into the GUI.\\n* Support KeeTouch touchscreens.\\n* Rotation quirks for Chuwi Ubook X 2023\\n* Extra properties to disable navbar, statusbar, taskbar and recents for BlissOS 15 & 16. This used to be a part of Bliss-Bass and has now been ported to BlissOS.\\n* Users can now fix their audio issues after install by putting their hardware\u2019s alsa state definitions in `/data/vendor/alsa/<hardware>.state`\\n* Updated KernelSU to latest version.\\n* **Virtual Console is back**, you can now press Ctrl + Alt + F1 to switch to it. If you want to unlock the console, add `androidboot.enable_console=1` to the cmdline. Bringing a virtual console also helps fixing another issue: hiding a small blinking cursor when using software rendering.\\n* Some tweaks for BlissOS Go taken from [GloDroid Project](https://github.com/GloDroid) .\\n* You can now disable the tablet taskbar on BlissOS 15 & 16. Patches were taken from [LMODroid](https://github.com/LMODroid) .\\n* [AutoFast JNI](https://web.archive.org/web/20220625232751/https://01.org/blogs/2019/intel-optimizations-android-pie-runtime-compiler) is now available on BlissOS 16.\\n* BlissOS 15 and 16 now have a new Sleep logo, and you can enable/disable the button on Blissify Settings => Power Menu"},{"id":"bliss-updates-1123","metadata":{"permalink":"/bliss-updates-1123","source":"@site/blog/2023/bliss-updates-1123.md","title":"Bliss OS - Development Updates 11-23","description":"BlissOS Updates","date":"2023-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 20, 2023","tags":[{"label":"blissos","permalink":"/tags/blissos"},{"label":"bliss-x86","permalink":"/tags/bliss-x-86"}],"readingTime":5.4,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Jon West","title":"Founder / Developer @BlissCoLabs / Incorporator & CTO / Bliss OS / Android-Generic Project @BlissLabs","url":"https://github.com/electrikjesus","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8572619?v=4","key":"electrikjesus"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"bliss-updates-1123","title":"Bliss OS - Development Updates 11-23","authors":["electrikjesus"],"description":"BlissOS Updates","img":"assets/blissos-updates-2023-11-20.png","date":"2023-11-20T00:00:00.000Z","comments":true,"tags":["blissos","bliss-x86"]},"prevItem":{"title":"A State Of Bliss : Wrapping up a Blissful year - Last Quarter of 2023 (and beginning of 2024)","permalink":"/asob-q3-2023-2024"},"nextItem":{"title":"BlissOS 16.8 codenamed Typhoon-x86 is now available","permalink":"/bliss-168"}},"content":"![alt text](assets/blissos-updates-2023-11-20.png \\"Bliss OS - Development Updates 11-23\\")\\n\\nSince the release of our stable Bliss OS 14.x & 15.x builds, we have had the chance to make a number of advancements on the OS in various areas. We will start the post with the updates coming from the value added contributions on the business side of things, then end with the updates being merged into the Bliss OS builds. \\n\\n\\n## Bliss Bass - beta builds started already\\n\\n![alt_text](assets/bliss-updates-1123/blissbass-tabletgo.png \\"Bliss Bass - Tablet Go - IOT/IIOT test build\\")\\n\\nWe have started to push some of the source for our Bliss Bass (Broad Apparatus Support System) builds that we use for customer focused builds based on Bliss OS, and the feedback from that has been pushing our development on the platform in a positive direction. These builds will be 100% ready for use in products, and will come with a number of added configuration options for features, UI/UX, updates, and more. We have released a few beta builds of the base FOSS variant of Bliss Bass for testing on Sourceforge. The initial flavors we will offer are:\\n\\n\\n* Kiosk variant\\n* Desktop variant\\n* Tablet variant\\n* Tablet Go - IOT/IIOT variant\\n* More on its way\\n\\nThere will be a new website created for these builds, and they will still be free to download and test, although the initial test builds will come watermarked. This will ensure that we are able to produce these test builds for the public while still retaining our licensing rights for it. \\n\\nWe are still collecting valuable information from our customers and would love to hear what our users think of this approach. Please leave a comment and let us know your thoughts. \\n\\n\\n# Bliss OS Updates\\n\\nThere are a few important changes that we are gearing up for on Bliss OS. First, on Bliss OS 14.x & 15.x, we will be shipping with Kernel 6.1, this includes our Surface builds. Second change will be for BlissOS 14.x, 15.x & 16.x (Generic/Surface), and that will be a switch to a new Audio HAL made by Intel\u2019s Project Celadon\\n\\nSwitching to the new Audio HAL will be an important change for us, so we would like to ask everyone to help us to test these new HAL so that we can have feedback and improve it further. Once tested, we will update the builds to include the new audio HAL changes. \\n\\nPlease join our Discord or Telegram to gain access to the new test builds of BlissOS 15.8.8 with Kernel 6.1.36 and the new Audio HAL.\\n\\n\\n## Go builds & Low RAM devices can now bypass some options in Settings\\n\\nIn BlissOS Go builds, there are some options that are being blocked by Android. Most notably the option to allow apps to draw on other apps. You will see this text when you are trying to grant the permission :\\n\\n\\n![alt_text](assets/bliss-updates-1123/image1.jpg \\"Draw over apps warning\\")\\n\\n\\nWith the latest update of BlissOS, we\'ve included a switch in Blissify Settings to allow bypassing this restriction. So now you are able to use apps like Smart Dock or Taskbar just like the usual generic version. The new option will be available in all of the upcoming BlissOS releases including 14, 15 and 16.\\n\\n\\n## A/B OTA Updates - rolling out soon\\n\\nOur efforts on Bliss Co-Labs have been paying off and we have a number of features and options developed from there heading to our open-source Bliss OS builds soon. The recently merged changes for the Bliss Setup Wizard for Bliss OS 15.x is one of those. \\n\\nThe other will be coming in the form of OTA updates for Bliss OS. These updates will bring the following improvements to the system:\\n\\n\\n* Separate A/B slots for all three images (system.img, initrd.img & kernel)\\n* System Rollbacks - Native bootctrl behavior\\n* Update server controlled by our own [Shipper Stack](https://github.com/shipperstack)\\n\\nWe have worked around a few issues with shipping sfs/erofs images and will keep the community posted on the progress. The early beta builds might not have all those fixes included just yet, so just be aware if you are trying to mount as read/write.\\n\\n\\n## Grub updates to v2.06 - also rolling out soon\\n\\nNow that we have the groundwork laid out for updating Grub with our A/B OTA updates, we decided it was best to update to the current version of Grub that Linux uses, and in doing so, we also solve an issue that 12th gen+ Intel CPU\u2019s have had where the screen is black after selecting any boot option from Grub. This means that the most recent gen CPU\u2019s will now be supported by both the kernel and the bootloader for Bliss OS. \\n\\nThis effort came from a few different contributors, so we have an initial solution we will likely release, and then split the other contributions into phases where we merge binary updates, libraries, modules, installer updates, and others separately in order to ensure stability as we move forward. \\n\\n\\n## OEM Install mode options - also rolling out soon\\n\\nBliss OS builds (and Android-x86)  have had some major issues with the auto-install mode that have been the source of many headaches and many long nights of reinstalling other operating systems in order to correct. So we took some time to update the current auto-install solution and give it a more proper name of OEM install, along with adding a few more options for unattended installation (Force):\\n\\n\\n* OEM Install (same as old auto-install, will require some interaction)\\n* OEM Install - Force MBR [Unattended Install] (if bios is set to use Legacy)\\n* OEM Install - Force EFI [Unattended Install] (if bios is set to use UEFI/EFI)\\n* OEM Install - Force [Unattended Install] (autodetect MBR/EFI)\\n* OEM Update - Will auto-update a previous default install or OEM install\\n\\nThese modes are intended for factory setup and will not work with devices that come with Windows unless you wipe all partitions except for EFI and leave a second OS partition with all the remaining space. \\n\\n\\n## We have more on the way\\n\\nWe don\u2019t want to spoil any of the surprises we have planned, so we will leave things here for this post. Just know that there will be a lot of contributions heading towards Bliss OS source, coming from the efforts of Bliss Co-Labs\u2019 and the community in helping bring our project even further than we ever thought possible. \\n\\nThanks again and enjoy the builds!"},{"id":"bliss-168","metadata":{"permalink":"/bliss-168","source":"@site/blog/2023/bliss-168.md","title":"BlissOS 16.8 codenamed Typhoon-x86 is now available","description":"BlissOS 16.8 release","date":"2023-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 15, 2023","tags":[{"label":"blissos","permalink":"/tags/blissos"},{"label":"bliss-x86","permalink":"/tags/bliss-x-86"}],"readingTime":2.115,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"HMTheBoy154","title":"Bliss OS Maintainer","url":"https://github.com/hmtheboy154","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39849246?v=4","key":"hmtheboy154"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"bliss-168","title":"BlissOS 16.8 codenamed Typhoon-x86 is now available","authors":["hmtheboy154"],"description":"BlissOS 16.8 release","img":"assets/bliss16.8/bliss16.8.jpg","date":"2023-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","comments":true,"tags":["blissos","bliss-x86"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Bliss OS - Development Updates 11-23","permalink":"/bliss-updates-1123"},"nextItem":{"title":"A State of Bliss : A Blissful Return - 2nd Quarter 2023","permalink":"/asob-q2-2023"}},"content":"![alt text](assets/bliss16.8/bliss16.8.jpg \\"A State of Bliss : A Blissful Return - 2nd Quarter 2023\\")\\n\\nJuly is a busy month for us here in BlissLabs. With the release of Android 13 QPR3, we\'ve decided that both BlissROMs and BlissOS this time will release the new updates on the same day which is pretty special for both of us.\\n\\nYou can check out all the changes BlissROMs made here for more info : https://blog.blissroms.org/2023-07-15-typhoon-16.8-updates-jul-2023/\\n\\n## BlissOS exclusive changes\\n\\nBeside from QPR3 and the changes made by BlissROMs, BlissOS offer some exclusive changes too. There are 3 main things :\\n\\n### New About Tablet design\\n\\n![alt text](assets/bliss16.8/abouttab.png)\\n\\nBlissROMs gave us the new About Phone/Tablet design, here we made a few modification to it. First, Processor name will show the actual CPU name of the device instead of getting the SoC name with prop `ro.soc.model`. Device name is a tablet instead of a phone and the screen to show the wallpaper is set to horizontal with 16:9 aspect ratio. Making this a nice tablet info screen for BlissOS.\\n\\n### Exclusive Launcher Features\\n\\nTo say this is an exclusive is a bit odd, because submitted the patches to Gerrit. But BlissROMs decided to put these in the next release (16.9) so we just gonna say that this is exclusive to BlissOS 16.8 :p. \\n\\nFirst, the Split button is now properly modified based on the new Recents button layouts. \\n\\n![alt text](assets/bliss16.8/split.png)\\n\\nNot only that, you can also turn it off in Recents Settings\\n\\n![alt text](assets/bliss16.8/splitsetting.png)\\n\\nNext, by default memory info in Recents is on the top of the screen, we\'ve provided an option to move it down again. We also calculated and change the margin of memory info when you are on Persistent Taskbar or Transient Taskbar so that meminfo will not be covered by taskbars.\\n\\n![alt text](assets/bliss16.8/meminfosetting.png)\\n![alt text](assets/bliss16.8/meminfo.png)\\n\\nFinally, **Developer Options is back** ! You can find it under Misc Settings when Developer Options in Settings is enabled.\\n\\n![alt text](assets/bliss16.8/devsettings.jpg)\\n\\n### Shipping with Kernel 6.1\\n\\nBlissOS 16.8 will be the first build to ship with Kernel 6.1. Currently I\'m still using the same recipe, Google\'s Common Kernel `android14-6.1-lts` branch with xanmod patches and some fixes for Android-x86 but because this is Kernel 6.1, more hardware will be supported especially the Steam Deck with some drivers & fixes from Valve that they put on their SteamOS\' kernel.\\n\\nAnd that\'s it for this month with the new release of 16.8, we hope that you will enjoy it even though for BlissOS 16 it\'s still in Beta stage.\\n\\n#StayBlissful #FeelTheWind\ud83c\udf2a"},{"id":"asob-q2-2023","metadata":{"permalink":"/asob-q2-2023","source":"@site/blog/2023/asob-q2-2023.md","title":"A State of Bliss : A Blissful Return - 2nd Quarter 2023","description":"A State of Bliss 2nd Quarter 2023","date":"2023-07-02T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 2, 2023","tags":[{"label":"blissos","permalink":"/tags/blissos"},{"label":"android-generic","permalink":"/tags/android-generic"},{"label":"bliss-x86","permalink":"/tags/bliss-x-86"},{"label":"lmodroid","permalink":"/tags/lmodroid"},{"label":"blissoslinux","permalink":"/tags/blissoslinux"}],"readingTime":14.95,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Jon West","title":"Founder / Developer @BlissCoLabs / Incorporator & CTO / Bliss OS / Android-Generic Project @BlissLabs","url":"https://github.com/electrikjesus","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8572619?v=4","key":"electrikjesus"},{"name":"HMTheBoy154","title":"Bliss OS Maintainer","url":"https://github.com/hmtheboy154","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39849246?v=4","key":"hmtheboy154"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"asob-q2-2023","title":"A State of Bliss : A Blissful Return - 2nd Quarter 2023","authors":["electrikjesus","hmtheboy154"],"description":"A State of Bliss 2nd Quarter 2023","img":"assets/asob_q2_2023/image6.png","date":"2023-07-02T00:00:00.000Z","comments":true,"tags":["blissos","android-generic","bliss-x86","lmodroid","blissoslinux"]},"prevItem":{"title":"BlissOS 16.8 codenamed Typhoon-x86 is now available","permalink":"/bliss-168"},"nextItem":{"title":"[announcement] Bliss OS Linux Hybrid Preview (Bliss OS Go edition)","permalink":"/bliss-os-linux-hybrid-preview"}},"content":"![alt text](assets/asob_q2_2023/image6.png \\"A State of Bliss : A Blissful Return - 2nd Quarter 2023\\")\\n\\nThe last couple months have been pretty busy at Bliss. Since January/February, we\u2019ve been able to get a lot of work done on many different fronts. With my return to Bliss, we\u2019ve started a collaborative contract development and consulting firm named [Bliss Co-Labs](https://blisscolabs.dev/), and have been working on a few client projects. Without letting the open-source side of things skip a beat, we\u2019ve also been busy making changes and working on quite a few new updates and projects. So we think it\u2019s about time to at least announce a few of the changes we have in store, as well as a few announcements for new projects or major project updates. \\n\\n## Updates\\n\\nLet\u2019s start with the release updates first. HMTheBoy154 has been busy pushing out some truly amazing innovations for Bliss OS, bringing the platform to support many more devices, and expanding its configurable layers past the graphics stack, and into many others. \\nHe has this to say about what has been going on recently:\\n\\n*Ever since Jon joined Esper, I\u2019ve decided to continue his work. If you join our Telegram group, you\u2019ll notice that a lot has changed since the last releases like Bliss OS 14.3 or 15.1. In this post, let\u2019s take a look at what\u2019s new in these versions.*\\n\\n### Bliss OS v14.10 Release\\n\\n![alt text](assets/asob_q2_2023/image9.png \\"Bliss OS v14.10 Release\\")\\n\\n*Compared to 14.3, the new Bliss OS 14.10 has improved a lot. Although there are some features that I have to remove for example the long iso name to explain what\'s inside the build or Gearlock (while it is a really good recovery solution for Android-x86, I still decided to remove it because it need to be rewritten), I\'ve been putting a lot of changes into it, some of them were on my old [ProjectSakura-x86](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/beta-11-projectsakura-x86-for-pcs-official.4329533/) builds. Also, please remember that most of these are also available in Bliss OS 15.8 builds and more on that later.*\\n\\n*Here are the new changes :*\\n\\n- Taskbar apps like farmerbb\'s Taskbar or axel358\'s Smart Dock are being updated to the latest.\\n- Kernel has been updated to 5.15.x, this is the same kernel I use on PS-x86 but now with more optimization & hardware support. Also mgLRU, eBPF, DMA-BUF Heap, etc are all being enabled.\\n- ESDFS is being used to bind mount apps\' data just like ChromeOS, this is to fix apps that can\'t be able to read data or obb on Bliss, causing it to crash.\\n- Using Intel\'s Bluetooth HAL, with some changes from Android-x86 to support more Bluetooth cards than just Intel one.\\n- You can now make a list like [modprobe.conf](https://linux.die.net/man/5/modprobe.conf) at /data/vendor/modules.options or /data/vendor/modules.blocklist if you want to blacklist a module.\\n- Bliss can now show the device information just like the old Bliss OS 11 or Android-x86.\\n- virt_wifi is now disabled by default, you can still use it with VIRT_WIFI=1\\n- If you are using a tablet or convertible laptops that have an accelerometer, our iio sensors can now be able to rotate the screen.\\n- PGO optimization for art. This is a feature by Intel to enhance VM workload performance, you can read about it [here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/enhance-vm-workloads-performance-with-pgo.html). \\n- AutoFast JNI, this is also [another feature by Intel](https://01.org/blogs/2019/intel-optimizations-android-pie-runtime-compiler) to improve performance on Android running in x86 hardware . \\n- zram is enabled by default with zstd compression.\\n- aptX & aptX HD Bluetooth codecs support using Android 13\'s encoders. Bliss is the first Android build on x86 hardware to get this publicly.\\n- `toybox` is being upstreamed with additional tools such as `eject` or `rfkill`. Also, we\'ve included usb.ids and pci.ids for `lsusb` & `lspci` so you can check the USB or PCI devices name.\\n- If you want to mount all of your partitions into Bliss, add `INTERNAL_MOUNT=1` into the cmdline.\\n- If you want to try AOSP\'s experimental \\"PC Mode\\", add `PC_MODE=1` into the cmdline and try.\\n- If you want your Bliss OS build to be recognized as a Google Play Games for PC image, add `HPE=1` into the cmdline and reset Play Store.\\n- You can now force your mouse click as touch, this is to help fixing apps that only use touch input only.\\n- Mouse acceleration can be disabled ,also scroll wheel too.\\n- Night Light is now available.\\n- BoringDroid is back. \\n- For media, while using OMX.ffmpeg codecs as usual, I also provide Codec2 implementation of ffmpeg codecs, made by Micheal Goffioul. Alongside with that, new VAAPI drivers for newer Intel iGPU & other hardware is also being built to support hardware acceleration decoder. I also include a lot of parameters that you can use to get the best result from Bliss OS, you can find it at our [Docs](https://docs.blissos.org/configuration/configuration-through-command-line-parameters/).\\n- For graphics, our graphics stack is being improved significantly compared to the previous builds, not only that, like media, we provide a lot of options through parameters too. You can see some of our changes here like : \\n  * Vulkan is now being enabled by default. `VULKAN=1` is dead, long live `VULKAN=1`. \\n  * Mesa is being updated to latest version (23.1) with LLVM16 for AMDGPUs.\\n  * Also in Mesa we\'ve activated xmlconfig, with this you can create custom configuration for apps & games related to graphics like spoofing GPUs name & vendor. We will update more information in our Docs soon.\\n  * While we include a lot of Gralloc & HWC options and we pick the best one depending on what GPU Bliss is running. So if you don\'t want to play with any of this, you can just be sure that you are running the best one that is being tested by us & the community.\\n  * For minigbm (and all the different variations that we have), you can switch to Gralloc4 with `GRALLOC4_MINIGBM=1` parameter.\\n  * You can force OpenGLES version with `FORCE_GLES=<version>` parameter.\\n  * For software rendering solutions, not only we are using Swiftshader, but also SwANGLE. A combination of ANGLE EGL driver & SwiftShader Vulkan made by Google. SwANGLE is already being used on Android 13 but we\'ve backported it.\\n\\n*And for the first time, Bliss is using the new KernelSU for root solution. Not only that, Bliss OS is the first x86_64 Android build ever to integrate KernelSU into it.*\\n\\n![alt text](assets/asob_q2_2023/image13.png \\"Bliss with KSU\\")\\n\\n*These builds will also be moved from our development branch to our stable branch, so you will soon find these builds on our [blissos-x86 sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/blissos-x86/) (where we release our stable builds).*\\n\\n### Bliss OS v15.8 Release\\n\\n![alt text](assets/asob_q2_2023/image11.png \\"Bliss OS v15.8 Release\\")\\n\\n*Bliss OS 15.8 has a different starting point than Bliss OS 15.1. Firstly, Bliss OS 15.8 is based on Android 12L unlike 15.1 which uses Android 12. Second, Bliss OS 15.8 common tree (`device/generic/common`) is based on my 14.10 tree with a few patches instead of using 15.1 one. Which is why I said that most of the new features from 14.10 are also available on 15.8. All the changes you see in 14.10 are also in this version, but with Android 12L instead.*\\n\\n*These builds will also be moved from our development branch to our stable branch, so you will soon find these builds on our [blissos-x86 sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/blissos-x86/) (where we release our stable builds).*\\n\\n### The return of Bliss OS Surface Builds\\n\\n![alt text](assets/asob_q2_2023/image10.png \\"Bliss OS Surface\\")\\n\\n*For Bliss OS, Surface Builds used to be a thing in Bliss OS 11 days with a few builds available. Now we\u2019re happy to announce that we\u2019re bringing back the build with a newer kernel (5.15) using patches from [linux-surface](https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface) and using the latest ipts/ithc kernel driver as well as iptsd daemon to support touchscreen.*\\n\\n***NOTE** : Not every Microsoft Surface device has to install surface build to make it work, some can just use generic builds, please check our [Documentation](https://docs.blissos.org/) for more info.*\\n\\n## Releases\\n\\nHMTheBoy154 has been working on a super secret project for Bliss, and we are happy to announce the initial beta release of Bliss OS v16.6 (Android 13) for x86_64v2 PC\u2019s, laptops, tablets, etc. Check the release notes for that below. \\n\\n### Bliss OS v16 Beta Release\\n\\n![alt text](assets/asob_q2_2023/image4.png \\"Bliss OS v16 Release\\")\\n\\n*Yes, you heard that right. Today I\'m happy to announce the first public beta build of Bliss OS 16. The development has already started since October 2022 and I\'ve been working together with not only Android-x86 members & contributors, but also with BlissROMs members and we\'ve made a lot of progress since then. We even work with the LibreMobileOS team to fix some issues like freeform.*\\n\\n*Currently BlissOS 16 is on 16.7 to match with the version on BlissROMs. While it\u2019s still on Beta stage, we can\'t wait to release our new images so you can experience them.*\\n\\n### New Bliss OS Logo Announcement\\n\\nWith the Bliss OS 16 announcement, Designer [XelXen (aka WildWaze)](https://github.com/xelxen/) has also been working with us on a redesigned logo for this and future releases. Not only that, he also included some new wallpapers for us to match with this new design elements.\\n\\n```\\n\u201cThe new logo of BlissOS depicts a human figure standing in between petals of lotus, representing the transparency and diversity of the operating system. The figure also holds a perfectly shaped lotus flower, which is the emblem of BlissLabs and perfection.\u201d\\n```\\n\\nLogo 1            |  Logo 2\\n:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:\\n![alt text](assets/asob_q2_2023/image12.png \\"Bliss OS v16\\")  | ![alt text](assets/asob_q2_2023/image14.png \\"Bliss OS v16\\")\\n\\nWallpaper 1            |  Wallpaper 2\\n:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:\\n![alt text](assets/asob_q2_2023/wall01.png \\"Bliss OS v16\\")  | ![alt text](assets/asob_q2_2023/wall02.png \\"Bliss OS v16\\")\\n\\nWallpaper 3            |  Wallpaper 4\\n:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:\\n![alt text](assets/asob_q2_2023/wall03.png \\"Bliss OS v16\\")  | ![alt text](assets/asob_q2_2023/wall04.png \\"Bliss OS v16\\")\\n\\n### Android-Generic Project Manager Release\\n\\nWe are excited to announce the release of Android-Generic Project Manager (AGPM), a tool that makes it easier to build and configure AOSP based projects. AGPM provides a number of features that can help you save time and effort, including:\\n\\n- Automatic repo init: AGPM can automatically initialize a new AOSP project or update an existing one.\\n- Python virtualenv support: AGPM can wrap your project in a Python virtualenv, which allows you to install packages and run scripts without affecting the rest of your system (quite handy when you are using a shared server over ssh and do not have root access for installing packages).\\n- Check Project Status: AGPM can check a project folders repos against the manifest, and it will build a list of any repos with uncommitted changes, or if the repos are not pushed yet. \\n- Option to push changes: Depending on what Update Checking finds, you can push your updates to the repos found to be behind\\n- Common Tools: Create New, Update, Delete, etc. \\n\\nScreenshots:\\n\\n![alt text](assets/asob_q2_2023/image8.jpg)\\n\\n(Main Menu window: Zenity mode)\\n\\n![alt text](assets/asob_q2_2023/image2.jpg)\\n\\n(Check Project Status results: Zenity mode)\\n\\nCompatibility:\\n\\nAGPM is designed to be flexible and extensible, so you can add your own project configurations and features. Currently, we support the following projects:\\n- AOSP\\n- Bliss ROM\\n- Lineage OS\\n- Bliss OS\\n\\nWe have a planned features list a mile long, and we are always working to add support for more projects. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue on the [AGPM GitHub repository](https://github.com/android-generic/ag-project-manager).\\n\\nWe hope you find AGPM to be a useful tool for building and configuring AOSP based projects.\\n\\n### Android-Generic Project (v2023) Release\\n\\nWe are excited to announce the release of Android-Generic Project (v2023), a major update that brings many new features and improvements.\\n\\nKey Features\\n\\n- Support for multiple targets: AG v2023 can now be used to build images for a variety of targets, including Android phones, tablets, Raspberry Pi, emulators, TVs, and PCs.

It is a toolkit that can be used to help with rebranding, customizations, and app changes for Bliss OS based builds. The toolkit comes with a variety of functions, including:\\n- An autopatch function that applies all required changes to the Bliss OS build.\\n- The ability to define custom sets of changes to be applied before customization.\\n- Integration with AOSP\'s build system, which allows a variety of tools to be accessed before the lunch process starts.\\n- The ability to display a customization menu from the pre-lunch hook, using either dialog or zenity, depending on whether or not a GUI is detected.\\n\\nThe Bliss-Bass toolkit is designed to make it easier for users and companies to start off using Bliss for their products. By automating many of the tasks involved in rebranding and customization, Bliss-Bass can save time and energy, allowing users or engineers to focus on the creative parts of the process.\\n\\nHere are some additional details about the autopatch function:\\n- The autopatch function is available from the command line using \u2018check_patchsets\u2019 or through the menu.\\n- The autopatch function can be used to apply a variety of changes to the Bliss OS build, including changes to the kernel, bootloader, system image, and vendor image.\\n- The autopatch function can be used to define custom sets of changes to be applied. This can be useful for organizations that need to make specific changes to Bliss OS for their own products.\\n\\nJust like some of our other toolkits, this project integrates itself into AOSP\u2019s build system and allows a variety of tools to be accessed before the lunch process starts:\\n\\n![alt text](assets/asob_q2_2023/image1.jpg)\\n\\nAnd when you trigger the customization menu to display from the pre-lunch hook, it can use \u2018dialog\u2019 if there is no display or GUI detected:\\n\\n![alt text](assets/asob_q2_2023/image3.jpg)\\n\\nOr `zenity`, to display the menu options if it does detect a GUI:\\n\\n![alt text](assets/asob_q2_2023/image5.jpg)\\n\\nFurther development is being made to add even more options and tools to Bliss-Bass. The project is open source and available on GitHub at https://github.com/BlissRoms-x86/platform_vendor_branding.\\n\\n### Bliss OS Linux Hybrid Preview\\n*(Bliss OS Go edition)*\\n\\n![alt text](assets/asob_q2_2023/image7.jpg)\\n\\nRead More in last weeks release post: [Bliss OS Linux Hybrid Preview](https://blog.blissos.org/bliss-os-linux-hybrid-preview)\\n\\n## New Collaborations\\n### LibreMobileOS\\n\\n![alt text](assets/asob_q2_2023/image15.png \\"LMODroid\\")\\n\\nWe are excited to announce our collaboration with [LibreMobileOS](https://libremobileos.com/), a project that develops and promotes privacy-focused mobile operating systems.

This helps accelerate the development of the idea or product by allowing open-innovation to take place.\\n\\n## Dismissing the current arguments against open-source development\\n\\nCan people take your code and use it for their own projects? The answer is yes, but this is not a bad thing at all. This is one of the things that empowers your idea by allowing you to see the improvements they made and how they made them, then adding those improvements into your code base.\\n\\nCan people alter your code to include malicious code? This depends on how well you manage the pull requests for your code, as even the Linux Kernel has had some bad-actors try and slip in malicious code before, and it was caught by the community. So you just need to make sure you define a strict set of rules for your project maintainers to follow when it comes to merging pull-requests from the community into your code base.\\n\\nCan you make money off Open-Source code? The answer to this is yes, and in many ways. It all comes down to how you design your project and the licensing you choose for it. As many open-source licenses do allow licensing, and support contracts, and many more options can be written into the standard licensing agreements.\\n\\n## How have we leveraged open-source for businesses?\\n\\nAs a consumer, you get to use the products of our work in open-source by testing our work (Bliss OS, Waydroid, Android-x86) on your laptop, tablet, desktop, server, etc. at no cost. \\nAs a business, our projects are limited in use, but can be licensed for inclusion into a project, and we offer development contracts to help businesses further develop their products, with our projects included. We have also created toolkits for businesses to use for free in the past, demonstrating the power of rapid-prototyping through the use of our services.\\n\\nFor other businesses, not used to working in open-source, there will always be hesitations. But that doesn\'t mean we can\'t make it work. We have had some restraints on projects in the past, and the solution for those proprietary constraints is typically to build a system that can handle allowing the end user to use it, while keeping all the private bits, private still. A perfect example of this is how Google Play, Widevine, libndk-translation, Houdini, and other private blobs are included in our projects. We have even gone one step further in this where allowed, and produced tools for the rest of the open-source community to use, that allows them to benefit from using the proprietary blobs, while keeping the businesses private intents intact.\\n\\nIt really all comes down to the mental attitude behind your innovation, and all in how you spin it. It\'s about time the market starts thinking on reasons why they should start going open-source, and not looking for all the reasons why they shouldn\'t."}]}')}}]);
