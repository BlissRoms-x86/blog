            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="alt text" src="/assets/images/asob-aug-25-7345b4ccc742c0126718b0fb673dc78e.png" title="Development Updates" width="1920" height="1080" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Let me tell you how busy we are without telling you we're busy... We are entering the end of the 60 day mark for transitioning on Bliss OS side of things. In this last 30 days, we've been able to finalize a method for tracking usage of our builds while making the data as anonymous as possible. The result will be a tiny service app that loads at the device start, and once the internet is available it will report the encrypted build info, and some minimal device info to our server so we can have a valid idea of how many devices are using our source or our images in the wild. </p><p>Our server upgrades are also starting to come online, piece by piece, which has given both the Bliss OS and Android-x86 teams a future proof build solution to help them out for at least the next few years. The hardest part to this setup was not getting the hardware put together though. Instead it was securing the connections to not allow the server to be constantly hit by attacks (yes, for some reason, there are entire teams of people with nothing better to do with their time than to try and attack the build infrastructure of our open-source projects... Like, what are they expecting to find? Something not free and open-source??...).</p><p>Along side those efforts, we have also started unification efforts for all sides of Bliss (ROM/OS/Business) where we took a step back, and looked at our project catalog on the FOSS side, and then the product catalog on the business side, and started working on the pieces we could connect in order to help make everything better. We have the initial parts of the plan already in motion and you will see the changes hitting Bliss vendor (ROM and OS sides) very soon. </p><p>Speaking of the ROM side, and PC sides, the progress on both those website updates has been going pretty well and we are going to be using more up to date web stack for them both in order to better serve our maintainability moving forward. With the majority of our new contributors having experience with Typescript and React, we felt that was the right direction to head if we are ever to allow things to grow on the website projects. </p><p>The PC side is also knee deep in the doc-swamp right now also. Since there is so much changing for Bliss OS builds and how they are installed, updated, and expanded, we have a lot of old documentation that will no longer be needed, and on the flip side, a lot of new documentation that is needed.<br>
<!-- -->That should just about cover the big items. There is a lot more we won’t mention just yet. You will have to wait and see for those updates when they hit. </p><p>Till next time, have a Blissful day<!-- -->!</p><p>Bliss OS Development Team</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Info about new BlissOS June 2024 updates]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="alt text" src="/assets/images/bliss16-new-updates-7b31565aef9ffada7895f4a1b968aa8c.png" title="What's new in BlissOS June 2024 releases ?" width="2160" height="1080" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>We've uploaded new builds to our SourceForge page. Here are the new things that we added to these builds:</p><ul><li>These new updates include BlissOS 14.10.2, BlissOS 15.9.1 &amp; BlissOS 16.9.6. All of them are now on latest May 2024 Security Patch, with BlissOS 14.10.2 is on Feb 2024 + unofficial patches from Lineage. We've decided to keep 14.10.2 date intact while still merging new patches.</li><li>We've updated the graphics stack including Mesa 24.0.8, LLVM 17.0.6 (for radeonsi), merging main branch for minigbm &amp; drm_hwcomposer. Libva (and also libva-utils) is being updated to 2.21.0</li><li>For audio, there are some changes to it that we want to pointed out:<ol><li>We've updated sof-firmware to version <a href="https://github.com/android-generic/vendor_intel_proprietary_sof-bin/tree/202403" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">202403</a>. </li><li>On BlissOS 16, we set snd_hda_intel driver to be <a href="https://github.com/BlissOS/device_generic_common/commit/8e64a9af5d5472fc3841092c8e3517dab532050b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deferred on purpose</a>. This is to fix the issue that on some old hardware audio is not working due to snd_hda_intel failed to probe the codec.</li><li>Finally and this is one of the most exciting change that we want to show you: <a href="https://github.com/BlissOS/device_generic_common/commit/2f8441797c9bdb2800d8fc969588980bf1aa1b75" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>we've refactored the whole audio initialization stage on init.sh</strong></a>. This refactor provides 2 features:<ul><li>After the first boot, the whole alsa state will be exported to /data/vendor/asound.state so the next boot alsactl will load this file instead of running the whole initialization stage again. This allow users to be able to play around with tools such as alsamixer and then save their own changes. Note that we don't have automatic save implemented yet so you'll have to type "alsa_ctl store" everytime you make a new change.</li><li>We're now support more audio cards that are in some Intel SoCs especially those tablets with Intel Atoms. By using alsaucm to enable HiFi verb &amp; all possible devices, we can now be able to support most of these audio cards (<a href="https://x.com/blissos_org/status/1788877000511528961" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://x.com/blissos_org/status/1788877000511528961</a>). Basically if you check dmesg and saw "no backend DAIs enabled for Audio Port" error spamming then yea that is now fixed.</li></ul></li></ol></li><li>We've created a new cmdline parameter : <a href="https://github.com/BlissOS/device_generic_common/commit/e47dddfa84713c0733f24b0c6ef8b43d9d63b6b9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FORCE_TSCAL=1</a>. Some users want to use the TSCalibration app to calibrate the touchscreen, but they didn't know that to make it works you need to run an extra function on init.sh, so we decided to make an option to force it. To avoid users confusion, we also hide the TSCalibration app if that function on init.sh is not being called. You can watch the preview here : <a href="https://youtu.be/p5z9yNhCNKE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://youtu.be/p5z9yNhCNKE</a></li><li>All builds (except Zenith) comes with kernel 6.1.84. There are a few things we've changed other than just upstreaming the kernel. <ol><li>We've integrated soc_button_array driver directly into the kernel. This helps fixing the side buttons not working on some Microsoft Surface devices.</li><li>We've <a href="https://github.com/android-generic/external_kernel-drivers/commit/e27764a43e29e837dda0e57970583da861dfd53c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">removed</a> the external rtl8723bs driver we are using and instead switched to the staging driver on the linux kernel source. 2 users feedback to us with working wifi after switching to it. But they also report to us they need to reboot in order to make it work. </li><li>We also <a href="https://github.com/android-generic/external_kernel-drivers/commit/b7ab4c7e7b071fe98f0b02f0b013b5b8d232e864" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">removed</a> gslx680-acpi driver out from our external drivers list. With the new cmdline option on touchscreen_dmi, we're now fully embracing silead_ts driver. You can read here to learn more about how this can help your silead touchscreen working on BlissOS: <a href="https://x.com/blissos_org/status/1795048924346032555" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://x.com/blissos_org/status/1795048924346032555</a></li></ol></li><li>We've brought <a href="https://github.com/android-generic/external_evtest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">evtest</a> tool to all of our new BlissOS builds as mentioned <a href="https://x.com/blissos_org/status/1795048933187518559" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></li><li>BlissOS Zenith is now using the latest Kernel 6.9.3 stable kernel. Different from the last build which uses 6.6 kernel from Google's <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/common/+/refs/heads/android15-6.6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">android15-6.6</a> branch, this is a new kernel that was made using <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/common/+/refs/heads/android-mainline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">android-mainline</a> branch, we got the source right when Google merge stable 6.9 and upstream it. Then we also merging patches from different places like <a href="https://github.com/android-generic/kernel-zenith/commits/6.9_android-x86" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android-x86</a>, <a href="https://github.com/android-generic/kernel-zenith/commits/6.9_xanmod" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">xanmod</a>, <a href="https://github.com/android-generic/kernel-zenith/commits/6.9_nobara" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nobara Linux</a>, etc.
You can check out the new Zenith kernel source <a href="https://github.com/android-generic/kernel-zenith/commits/6.9/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></li></ul><p>During testing, we've found some critical bugs that we would like to address:</p><ul><li>We've updated KernelSU but only to version 0.9.2. While the latest version 1.0 is out, ever since 0.9.3 there is a bug on KernelSU that prevent us from updating. On live boot, KSU will work as intended but once installed it will show "not installed" and be unusable. We've reported this bug to KernelSU's Github Issues and we're waiting for a fix: <a href="https://github.com/tiann/KernelSU/issues/1783" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/tiann/KernelSU/issues/1783</a></li><li>When we say "we are now able to support most of these audio cards", not only does it mean we haven't tested all of the audio cards, but also there are some that is not working right now. For example an user has reported to us on Discord that his audio is not working and it's a Thinkpad 10 that currently using "cht-bsw-rt5672".</li><li>All of our audio test on Intel Atom SoCs have 1 bug in common: playing anything with audio for a while and then suddenly the audio stream is cut, producing strange buzzing noise that you need to temporary pause the audio to fix until it happen again.</li><li><strong>Users on BlissOS Zenith please pay attention to this !</strong> Currently Zenith kernel has an issue, and that is KernelSU.... again ! KernelSU while can be able to show that it's working &amp; can grant root for apps, apps can not be able to call su at all ! For now you can't grant root for app but if you want to run any commands with root you can boot with <code>androidboot.enable_console=1</code> and use Alt + F1 tty.</li></ul><p>We're hoping that we can be able to fix these bugs in future updates. In the meantime, please enjoy these new builds from us. Thank you for reading this blog post and supporting BlissOS.</p><p>#StayBlissful</p>]]></content:encoded>

After 4 years of supporting the OS, we are planning on the day that we officially pulled the plug &amp; stop supporting this version of BlissOS.
<a href="https://fixupx.com/electrikjesus/status/1341183060713324547" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://fixupx.com/electrikjesus/status/1341183060713324547</a></p><p>In case you didn't know, the last security patch for AOSP 11 was officially released by Google on Feburary, 2024:

And after discussion, we've decided to prolong the support for BlissOS 14 until April 2025. During this time, we will:</p><ul><li>Merging new security patches by using <a href="https://review.lineageos.org/q/topic:%22R_asb_2024-05%22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unofficial Lineage backport</a></li><li>Bumping the kernel to at least 6.6.x LTS</li><li>Updating Mesa to 24.0 and up</li><li>Backporting changes from higher BlissOS version if possible.</li></ul><p>While we will commit to support the OS until next year, <strong>we will not guarantee the safety of the OS</strong>. Which is why soon we will list this as "old stable" and we will encourage users to use higher versions of BlissOS if possible.</p><p>Support on our Telegram &amp; Discord are also the same. When the version is reaching end-of-life, we will not providing support on those platform anymore.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="alt text" src="/assets/images/asob-eoy23-8763430913ce10c1a6022e3f31260e78.jpeg" title="A State of Bliss : Wrapping up a Blissful year - Last Quarter of 2023 (and beginning of 2024" width="1920" height="1080" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>It is that time of the year to share and look forward to the future, so we are back with another update on what all we have been up to and where we are headed from here.</p><p>Leading Up To Now</p><p>We have been working on merging upstream changes, our install process, our update process, and adding more features and configuration options to Bliss OS, and much of that work is getting ready for release.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-revamped-bootable-installer">A revamped bootable installer<a href="#a-revamped-bootable-installer" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A revamped bootable installer" title="Direct link to A revamped bootable installer">​</a></h2><p>While there are many reports that the bootable installer was really buggy in recent years, because there are alternatives like Grub2Win or manual Linux dual-boot setup we haven’t spent much time on it. However, with the shocking discover that Grub2Win, a project that we and many people are using to install and dual-boot BlissOS <a href="https://twitter.com/blissos_org/status/1700613048518795683" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is doing something inappropriate</a> , we realized that it’s time and decide to look back at our bootable installer to completely revamped it :</p><ul><li>Both the installer and the initrd now will use latest busybox 1.36.1 built by Docker (<a href="https://github.com/docker-library/busybox" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/docker-library/busybox</a>)</li><li>Almost all of the libraries &amp; programs are now using prebuilts from Debian 13 i386 instead of the old one from Android-x86 (which was taken from an old version of Fedora).</li><li>efivar and efibootmgr are still being built from source, but are being updated to latest versions.</li><li>Grub has been bumped to Grub 2.06 for both Legacy BIOS or UEFI. Bumping Grub2 to the latest stable version also helps <strong>fixing black screen issues when trying to install</strong>.</li><li>Support installing with exFAT or F2FS (experimental).</li><li>UEFI users can now be able to manually choose the ESP (EFI System Partition) if they want, this is for people who have multiple ESP in their setup or just want to make sure that the installer picks the correct partition. We also allow users to change the label on the folder or on the UEFI entry if you want more customization.</li><li>Some label and text edit for better comprehensiveness of what the installer tries to do.</li><li>Support install with rEFInd for UEFI users, it is still in the experimental stage so please consider carefully before choosing it.</li><li>Using rsync for the files copy stage as it can fix an annoying problem that the progress bar will reach 200% when done.</li></ul><p>We believe that with these new changes, users will have a great experience setting up the OS. Just a small caution : Unlike Android-x86, we haven’t planned to support Secure Boot yet so please disable it before trying to install the OS.</p><p>Check out the screenshot here if you are interested : <a href="https://t.me/hmdumbground/111" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.me/hmdumbground/111</a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="an-approach-to-ota-updates-on-blissos">An approach to OTA updates on BlissOS<a href="#an-approach-to-ota-updates-on-blissos" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to An approach to OTA updates on BlissOS" title="Direct link to An approach to OTA updates on BlissOS">​</a></h2><p>A few months ago, we reached out to <a href="https://github.com/erfanoabdi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@erfanoabdi</a> for a solution to OTA updates. This was intended for Bliss Co-Labs clients and later applied to BlissOS and it is unlike any other OTA method that any Android-x86 or other derivative used to use. The idea here is utilizing virtual A/B by making a bootctrl HAL that will edit Grub configuration to switch between the two slots. The advantage is that with virtual A/B, users can still be able to use the OS while it’s updating because the update is being handled in another slot. Also other custom ROMs can easily use our method as the update is being handled by LineageUpdater, which is being used by many.</p><p>The disadvantages that we observed is that this method does not support filesystems that are handled by <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/next/filesystems/fuse.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FUSE</a> , so if you install BlissOS on an NTFS partition, you will not be able to use it. Another issue is that because switching slot is to edit a config file, manual Linux dual-boot will now have to take extra steps if you want OTA support. We will soon update it in our Documentation.</p><p>All versions that we are maintaining will support OTA. This includes BlissOS 14, 15 and 16. Please install the new builds to get the latest OTA updates in the future.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="av1-support-for-ffmpeg-codecs">AV1 support for ffmpeg codecs<a href="#av1-support-for-ffmpeg-codecs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to AV1 support for ffmpeg codecs" title="Direct link to AV1 support for ffmpeg codecs">​</a></h2><p>Thanks to the work of <a href="https://konstakang.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@KonstaKANG</a>, we’ve been able to bring AV1 support into our ffmpeg codecs. Currently AV1 is being handled by <a href="https://code.videolan.org/videolan/dav1d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">libdav1d</a> made by the developers at VLC and being built using <a href="https://github.com/GloDroid/aospext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GloDroid’s AOSPExt</a>. We are also planning to support VA-API AV1 soon for hardware-accelerated solution.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="properly-handle-suspend">Properly handle suspend<a href="#properly-handle-suspend" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Properly handle suspend" title="Direct link to Properly handle suspend">​</a></h2><p>While making her first big contribution to the project which is providing fixes to the Steam Deck, our friend <a href="https://github.com/Kethen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Kethen</a> has decided to help us tackle the suspend issue. Suspending the machine or waking it up now feels less buggy than before.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="blissos-go-for-all-versions">BlissOS Go for all versions<a href="#blissos-go-for-all-versions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to BlissOS Go for all versions" title="Direct link to BlissOS Go for all versions">​</a></h2><p>Announced in June with only 15 (Android 12L) versions, BlissOS Go is still being continued to develop and now we are announcing that the Go version will be available to all BlissOS versions, including 14, 15 and 16 with both Gapps or FOSS variants.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="bump-to-kernel-61-for-all-builds">Bump to kernel 6.1 for all builds<a href="#bump-to-kernel-61-for-all-builds" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Bump to kernel 6.1 for all builds" title="Direct link to Bump to kernel 6.1 for all builds">​</a></h2><p>Kernel 6.1 has been tested internally and is available on BlissOS 16 for a while now and we decided to finally release all of our BlissOS versions with it. Still the same combination of Google’s Android common kernel source + Android-x86 patches + some xanmod patches. Now with more hardware supported especially the Steam Deck with some drivers &amp; fixes being pulled directly from Valve.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="introducing-blissos-zenith">Introducing BlissOS Zenith<a href="#introducing-blissos-zenith" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Introducing BlissOS Zenith" title="Direct link to Introducing BlissOS Zenith">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="alt text" src="/assets/images/BLISS-OS_ZENITH-0c69d500cecf943295f5db8d4360e9d1.png" title="Bliss OS Zenith" width="1920" height="1080" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>We realized that there are users out there who are using hardware that are too new for the kernel in BlissOS to support. This is a challenge as we know that we can’t just build all the current BlissOS versions with stable or mainline kernel, that would risk the stability of the OS. So we’ve decided that we will make another variant, this time with 2 key differences :</p><ul><li>Only build the latest version of BlissOS available for this variant, so for now it’s 16.</li><li>Using stable branch of the linux kernel.</li></ul><p>We want to make this build for users that have new hardware or the one that always wants the latest, latest version of BlissOS and the latest kernel. With that said, we still need a name for this new variant. This gave us an idea, “What if we ask our community ?” and decide to ask people to give this new build a name on our <a href="https://twitter.com/blissos_org/status/1733872766133403666" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>  &amp; our group chat. After looking through all the suggestions, we’ve decided to choose <code>Zenith</code> .</p><p> \
BlissOS Zenith, The new flagship build of BlissOS, intended for "chasing the latest". Starting now with version 16.9.4 and kernel 6.6</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="other-updates">Other updates<a href="#other-updates" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Other updates" title="Direct link to Other updates">​</a></h2><ul><li>A lot of fixes for Steam Deck, even a dedicated sensor HAL thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Kethen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Kethen</a> (again).</li><li>alsa-info.sh is now being included into BlissOS, this will generate a file with all the necessary information related to audio, this is intended to debug audio issues.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/thesofproject/sof-bin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sof-firmware</a> from Intel is being included to support more audio hardware.</li><li>All builds are now using Mesa 23.3.3</li><li>Some fixes to the sensors HAL (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Kethen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Kethen</a> again)</li><li>Fixed an issue that desktop Nvidia GPUs with nouveau can’t be able to get into the GUI.</li><li>Support KeeTouch touchscreens.</li><li>Rotation quirks for Chuwi Ubook X 2023</li><li>Extra properties to disable navbar, statusbar, taskbar and recents for BlissOS 15 &amp; 16.

            <description><![CDATA[BlissOS Updates]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="alt text" src="/assets/images/blissos-updates-2023-11-20-9e5e079df9f123ff33805323b4b0b249.png" title="Bliss OS - Development Updates 11-23" width="1920" height="1080" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Since the release of our stable Bliss OS 14.x &amp; 15.x builds, we have had the chance to make a number of advancements on the OS in various areas. We will start the post with the updates coming from the value added contributions on the business side of things, then end with the updates being merged into the Bliss OS builds. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="bliss-bass---beta-builds-started-already">Bliss Bass - beta builds started already<a href="#bliss-bass---beta-builds-started-already" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Bliss Bass - beta builds started already" title="Direct link to Bliss Bass - beta builds started already">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="alt_text" src="/assets/images/blissbass-tabletgo-675a87e42bd4012ea26cc659c8c84159.png" title="Bliss Bass - Tablet Go - IOT/IIOT test build" width="2160" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>We have started to push some of the source for our Bliss Bass (Broad Apparatus Support System) builds that we use for customer focused builds based on Bliss OS, and the feedback from that has been pushing our development on the platform in a positive direction. These builds will be 100% ready for use in products, and will come with a number of added configuration options for features, UI/UX, updates, and more. We have released a few beta builds of the base FOSS variant of Bliss Bass for testing on Sourceforge. The initial flavors we will offer are:</p><ul><li>Kiosk variant</li><li>Desktop variant</li><li>Tablet variant</li><li>Tablet Go - IOT/IIOT variant</li><li>More on its way</li></ul><p>There will be a new website created for these builds, and they will still be free to download and test, although the initial test builds will come watermarked. This will ensure that we are able to produce these test builds for the public while still retaining our licensing rights for it. </p><p>We are still collecting valuable information from our customers and would love to hear what our users think of this approach. Please leave a comment and let us know your thoughts. </p><h1>Bliss OS Updates</h1><p>There are a few important changes that we are gearing up for on Bliss OS. First, on Bliss OS 14.x &amp; 15.x, we will be shipping with Kernel 6.1, this includes our Surface builds. Second change will be for BlissOS 14.x, 15.x &amp; 16.x (Generic/Surface), and that will be a switch to a new Audio HAL made by Intel’s Project Celadon</p><p>Switching to the new Audio HAL will be an important change for us, so we would like to ask everyone to help us to test these new HAL so that we can have feedback and improve it further. Once tested, we will update the builds to include the new audio HAL changes. </p><p>Please join our Discord or Telegram to gain access to the new test builds of BlissOS 15.8.8 with Kernel 6.1.36 and the new Audio HAL.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="go-builds--low-ram-devices-can-now-bypass-some-options-in-settings">Go builds &amp; Low RAM devices can now bypass some options in Settings<a href="#go-builds--low-ram-devices-can-now-bypass-some-options-in-settings" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Go builds &amp; Low RAM devices can now bypass some options in Settings" title="Direct link to Go builds &amp; Low RAM devices can now bypass some options in Settings">​</a></h2><p>In BlissOS Go builds, there are some options that are being blocked by Android. Most notably the option to allow apps to draw on other apps. You will see this text when you are trying to grant the permission :</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="alt_text" src="/assets/images/image1-6e74d231c48311a7c4000e8fd1e26a71.jpg" title="Draw over apps warning" width="720" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>With the latest update of BlissOS, we've included a switch in Blissify Settings to allow bypassing this restriction. So now you are able to use apps like Smart Dock or Taskbar just like the usual generic version. The new option will be available in all of the upcoming BlissOS releases including 14, 15 and 16.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ab-ota-updates---rolling-out-soon">A/B OTA Updates - rolling out soon<a href="#ab-ota-updates---rolling-out-soon" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A/B OTA Updates - rolling out soon" title="Direct link to A/B OTA Updates - rolling out soon">​</a></h2><p>Our efforts on Bliss Co-Labs have been paying off and we have a number of features and options developed from there heading to our open-source Bliss OS builds soon. The recently merged changes for the Bliss Setup Wizard for Bliss OS 15.x is one of those. </p><p>The other will be coming in the form of OTA updates for Bliss OS. These updates will bring the following improvements to the system:</p><ul><li>Separate A/B slots for all three images (system.img, initrd.img &amp; kernel)</li><li>System Rollbacks - Native bootctrl behavior</li><li>Update server controlled by our own <a href="https://github.com/shipperstack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shipper Stack</a></li></ul><p>We have worked around a few issues with shipping sfs/erofs images and will keep the community posted on the progress. The early beta builds might not have all those fixes included just yet, so just be aware if you are trying to mount as read/write.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="grub-updates-to-v206---also-rolling-out-soon">Grub updates to v2.06 - also rolling out soon<a href="#grub-updates-to-v206---also-rolling-out-soon" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Grub updates to v2.06 - also rolling out soon" title="Direct link to Grub updates to v2.06 - also rolling out soon">​</a></h2><p>Now that we have the groundwork laid out for updating Grub with our A/B OTA updates, we decided it was best to update to the current version of Grub that Linux uses, and in doing so, we also solve an issue that 12th gen+ Intel CPU’s have had where the screen is black after selecting any boot option from Grub. This means that the most recent gen CPU’s will now be supported by both the kernel and the bootloader for Bliss OS. </p><p>This effort came from a few different contributors, so we have an initial solution we will likely release, and then split the other contributions into phases where we merge binary updates, libraries, modules, installer updates, and others separately in order to ensure stability as we move forward. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="oem-install-mode-options---also-rolling-out-soon">OEM Install mode options - also rolling out soon<a href="#oem-install-mode-options---also-rolling-out-soon" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to OEM Install mode options - also rolling out soon" title="Direct link to OEM Install mode options - also rolling out soon">​</a></h2><p>Bliss OS builds (and Android-x86)  have had some major issues with the auto-install mode that have been the source of many headaches and many long nights of reinstalling other operating systems in order to correct. So we took some time to update the current auto-install solution and give it a more proper name of OEM install, along with adding a few more options for unattended installation (Force):</p><ul><li>OEM Install (same as old auto-install, will require some interaction)</li><li>OEM Install - Force MBR <!-- -->[Unattended Install]<!-- --> (if bios is set to use Legacy)</li><li>OEM Install - Force EFI <!-- -->[Unattended Install]<!-- --> (if bios is set to use UEFI/EFI)</li><li>OEM Install - Force <!-- -->[Unattended Install]<!-- --> (autodetect MBR/EFI)</li><li>OEM Update - Will auto-update a previous default install or OEM install</li></ul><p>These modes are intended for factory setup and will not work with devices that come with Windows unless you wipe all partitions except for EFI and leave a second OS partition with all the remaining space. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="we-have-more-on-the-way">We have more on the way<a href="#we-have-more-on-the-way" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to We have more on the way" title="Direct link to We have more on the way">​</a></h2><p>We don’t want to spoil any of the surprises we have planned, so we will leave things here for this post. Just know that there will be a lot of contributions heading towards Bliss OS source, coming from the efforts of Bliss Co-Labs’ and the community in helping bring our project even further than we ever thought possible. </p><p>Thanks again and enjoy the builds!</p>]]></content:encoded>

With the release of Android 13 QPR3, we've decided that both BlissROMs and BlissOS this time will release the new updates on the same day which is pretty special for both of us.</p><p>You can check out all the changes BlissROMs made here for more info : <a href="https://blog.blissroms.org/2023-07-15-typhoon-16.8-updates-jul-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://blog.blissroms.org/2023-07-15-typhoon-16.8-updates-jul-2023/</a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="blissos-exclusive-changes">BlissOS exclusive changes<a href="#blissos-exclusive-changes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to BlissOS exclusive changes" title="Direct link to BlissOS exclusive changes">​</a></h2><p>Beside from QPR3 and the changes made by BlissROMs, BlissOS offer some exclusive changes too. There are 3 main things :</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="new-about-tablet-design">New About Tablet design<a href="#new-about-tablet-design" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to New About Tablet design" title="Direct link to New About Tablet design">​</a></h3><p><img loading="lazy" alt="alt text" src="/assets/images/abouttab-755ef8ba479214295bd9c94406cc17b5.png" width="2560" height="1440" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>BlissROMs gave us the new About Phone/Tablet design, here we made a few modification to it. First, Processor name will show the actual CPU name of the device instead of getting the SoC name with prop <code>ro.soc.model</code>. Device name is a tablet instead of a phone and the screen to show the wallpaper is set to horizontal with 16:9 aspect ratio. Making this a nice tablet info screen for BlissOS.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="exclusive-launcher-features">Exclusive Launcher Features<a href="#exclusive-launcher-features" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Exclusive Launcher Features" title="Direct link to Exclusive Launcher Features">​</a></h3><p>To say this is an exclusive is a bit odd, because submitted the patches to Gerrit. But BlissROMs decided to put these in the next release (16.9) so we just gonna say that this is exclusive to BlissOS 16.8 :p. </p><p>First, the Split button is now properly modified based on the new

Since January/February, we’ve been able to get a lot of work done on many different fronts. With my return to Bliss, we’ve started a collaborative contract development and consulting firm named <a href="https://blisscolabs.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bliss Co-Labs</a>, and have been working on a few client projects. Without letting the open-source side of things skip a beat, we’ve also been busy making changes and working on quite a few new updates and projects. So we think it’s about time to at least announce a few of the changes we have in store, as well as a few announcements for new projects or major project updates. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="updates">Updates<a href="#updates" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Updates" title="Direct link to Updates">​</a></h2><p>Let’s start with the release updates first. HMTheBoy154 has been busy pushing out some truly amazing innovations for Bliss OS, bringing the platform to support many more devices, and expanding its configurable layers past the graphics stack, and into many others.
He has this to say about what has been going on recently:</p><p><em>Ever since Jon joined Esper, I’ve decided to continue his work. If you join our Telegram group, you’ll notice that a lot has changed since the last releases like Bliss OS 14.3 or 15.1. In this post, let’s take a look at what’s new in these versions.</em></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="bliss-os-v1410-release">Bliss OS v14.10 Release<a href="#bliss-os-v1410-release" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Bliss OS v14.10 Release" title="Direct link to Bliss OS v14.10 Release">​</a></h3><p><img loading="lazy" alt="alt text" src="/assets/images/image9-f5b5399310116d64041780b35e6356a9.png" title="Bliss OS v14.10 Release" width="1999" height="1125" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><em>Compared to 14.3, the new Bliss OS 14.10 has improved a lot. Although there are some features that I have to remove for example the long iso name to explain what's inside the build or Gearlock (while it is a really good recovery solution for Android-x86, I still decided to remove it because it need to be rewritten), I've been putting a lot of changes into it, some of them were on my old <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/beta-11-projectsakura-x86-for-pcs-official.4329533/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ProjectSakura-x86</a> builds. Also, please remember that most of these are also available in Bliss OS 15.8 builds and more on that later.</em></p><p><em>Here are the new changes :</em></p><ul><li>Taskbar apps like farmerbb's Taskbar or axel358's Smart Dock are being updated to the latest.</li><li>Kernel has been updated to 5.15.x, this is the same kernel I use on PS-x86 but now with more optimization &amp; hardware support. Also mgLRU, eBPF, DMA-BUF Heap, etc are all being enabled.</li><li>ESDFS is being used to bind mount apps' data just like ChromeOS, this is to fix apps that can't be able to read data or obb on Bliss, causing it to crash.</li><li>Using Intel's Bluetooth HAL, with some changes from Android-x86 to support more Bluetooth cards than just Intel one.</li><li>You can now make a list like <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/5/modprobe.conf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">modprobe.conf</a> at /data/vendor/modules.options or /data/vendor/modules.blocklist if you want to blacklist a module.</li><li>Bliss can now show the device information just like the old Bliss OS 11 or Android-x86.</li><li>virt_wifi is now disabled by default, you can still use it with VIRT_WIFI=1</li><li>If you are using a tablet or convertible laptops that have an accelerometer, our iio sensors can now be able to rotate the screen.</li><li>PGO optimization for art. This is a feature by Intel to enhance VM workload performance, you can read about it <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/enhance-vm-workloads-performance-with-pgo.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. </li><li>AutoFast JNI, this is also <a href="https://01.org/blogs/2019/intel-optimizations-android-pie-runtime-compiler" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another feature by Intel</a> to improve performance on Android running in x86 hardware . </li><li>zram is enabled by default with zstd compression.</li><li>aptX &amp; aptX HD Bluetooth codecs support using Android 13's encoders. Bliss is the first Android build on x86 hardware to get this publicly.</li><li><code>toybox</code> is being upstreamed with additional tools such as <code>eject</code> or <code>rfkill</code>. Also, we've included usb.ids and pci.ids for <code>lsusb</code> &amp; <code>lspci</code> so you can check the USB or PCI devices name.</li><li>If you want to mount all of your partitions into Bliss, add <code>INTERNAL_MOUNT=1</code> into the cmdline.</li><li>If you want to try AOSP's experimental "PC Mode", add <code>PC_MODE=1</code> into the cmdline and try.</li><li>If you want your Bliss OS build to be recognized as a Google Play Games for PC image, add <code>HPE=1</code> into the cmdline and reset Play Store.</li><li>You can now force your mouse click as touch, this is to help fixing apps that only use touch input only.</li><li>Mouse acceleration can be disabled ,also scroll wheel too.</li><li>Night Light is now available.</li><li>BoringDroid is back. </li><li>For media, while using OMX.ffmpeg codecs as usual, I also provide Codec2 implementation of ffmpeg codecs, made by Micheal Goffioul. Alongside with that, new VAAPI drivers for newer Intel iGPU &amp; other hardware is also being built to support hardware acceleration decoder. I also include a lot of parameters that you can use to get the best result from Bliss OS, you can find it at our <a href="https://docs.blissos.org/configuration/configuration-through-command-line-parameters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docs</a>.</li><li>For graphics, our graphics stack is being improved significantly compared to the previous builds, not only that, like media, we provide a lot of options through parameters too. You can see some of our changes here like : <ul><li>Vulkan is now being enabled by default. <code>VULKAN=1</code> is dead, long live <code>VULKAN=1</code>. </li><li>Mesa is being updated to latest version (23.1) with LLVM16 for AMDGPUs.</li><li>Also in Mesa we've activated xmlconfig, with this you can create custom configuration for apps &amp; games related to graphics like spoofing GPUs name &amp; vendor. We will update more information in our Docs soon.</li><li>While we include a lot of Gralloc &amp; HWC options and we pick the best one depending on what GPU Bliss is running. So if you don't want to play with any of this, you can just be sure that you are running the best one that is being tested by us &amp; the community.</li><li>For minigbm (and all the different variations that we have), you can switch to Gralloc4 with <code>GRALLOC4_MINIGBM=1</code> parameter.</li><li>You can force OpenGLES version with <code>FORCE_GLES=&lt;version&gt;</code> parameter.</li><li>For software rendering solutions, not only we are using Swiftshader, but also SwANGLE. A combination of ANGLE EGL driver &amp; SwiftShader Vulkan made by Google. SwANGLE is already being used on Android 13 but we've backported it.</li></ul></li></ul><p><em>And for the first time, Bliss is using the new KernelSU for root solution.

It is a toolkit that can be used to help with rebranding, customizations, and app changes for Bliss OS based builds. The toolkit comes with a variety of functions, including:</p><ul><li>An autopatch function that applies all required changes to the Bliss OS build.</li><li>The ability to define custom sets of changes to be applied before customization.</li><li>Integration with AOSP's build system, which allows a variety of tools to be accessed before the lunch process starts.</li><li>The ability to display a customization menu from the pre-lunch hook, using either dialog or zenity, depending on whether or not a GUI is detected.</li></ul><p>The Bliss-Bass toolkit is designed to make it easier for users and companies to start off using Bliss for their products. By automating many of the tasks involved in rebranding and customization, Bliss-Bass can save time and energy, allowing users or engineers to focus on the creative parts of the process.</p><p>Here are some additional details about the autopatch function:</p><ul><li>The autopatch function is available from the command line using ‘check_patchsets’ or through the menu.</li><li>The autopatch function can be used to apply a variety of changes to the Bliss OS build, including changes to the kernel, bootloader, system image, and vendor image.</li><li>The autopatch function can be used to define custom sets of changes to be applied. This can be useful for organizations that need to make specific changes to Bliss OS for their own products.</li></ul><p>Just like some of our other toolkits, this project integrates itself into AOSP’s build system and allows a variety of tools to be accessed before the lunch process starts:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="alt text" src="/assets/images/image1-2ed9e31e55f447722805f91078996b2c.jpg" width="880" height="343" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>And when you trigger the customization menu to display from the pre-lunch hook, it can use ‘dialog’ if there is no display or GUI detected:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="alt text" src="/assets/images/image3-db90a1fc2e9fb41bf5f8ff3e2fae0aa2.jpg" width="861" height="527" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Or <code>zenity</code>, to display the menu options if it does detect a GUI:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="alt text" src="/assets/images/image5-3da8ba68c25d63180b8dd9d95a4d3d13.jpg" width="502" height="403" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Further development is being made to add even more options and tools to Bliss-Bass.

The operating system will be pre-installed with a variety of privacy-focused applications, including a web browser, desktop mode, digital wellbeing (coming soon), and file manager.</p><p>We believe that LMODroid-x86 will be a valuable addition to the LibreMobileOS ecosystem. The operating system will provide users with a privacy-focused alternative to the major mobile operating systems, and it will help to promote the use of open-source software.
We would like to thank LibreMobileOS for their collaboration on this project. We are excited to work with them to develop LMODroid-x86 and to help make it available to users around the world.</p><p>We would also like to thank HMTheBoy154 for their contributions to this project. Their hard work and dedication has been essential to the success of the project.</p><p>We are confident that LMODroid-x86 will be a valuable resource for users who are looking for a privacy-focused and secure mobile operating system. We look forward to sharing more information about the project in the coming months.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The pilot program aims to allow millions of devices a second-life through the use of Bliss OS, which is specifically tailored to the devices' hardware and capabilities.</p><p>Bliss OS is a lightweight operating system that is designed to run on x86 Windows &amp; Linux devices. It is based on Android, but it has been optimized for performance and battery life. Bliss OS Go is a version of Bliss OS that is designed for lower-powered devices, such as the Intel Atom based Windows tablets that are used in Kenya.</p><p>The pilot program will test the feasibility of deploying Bliss OS Go on the Windows tablets. If the pilot is successful, it could lead to the deployment of Bliss OS Go on millions of devices, which would provide students in Kenya with access to a more reliable and affordable educational platform.</p><p>Here are some of the benefits of using Bliss OS Go on the Windows tablets:</p><ul><li>Improved performance: Bliss OS Go is designed to run on low-powered devices, so it can provide a significant performance boost over Windows. This will make it easier for students to use the devices for learning.</li><li>Longer battery life: Bliss OS Go is also designed to conserve battery life, so students can use the devices for longer periods of time without having to worry about running out of power.</li><li>More affordable: Bliss OS Go is a free and open-source operating system, so it is more affordable than Windows. This will make it possible for schools to deploy Bliss OS Go on more devices, which will benefit more students.</li></ul><p>We believe that Bliss OS Go has the potential to make a significant impact on education in Kenya. We are excited to partner with EIDU on this pilot program and we look forward to seeing the results.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a business, the typical way to do things is to file for patents, and protect your product or idea, and your product team produces the development design and manages updating the product for its lifecycle. The downside to that is that only your team has the ability to spot its flaws, make it better, or see other avenues where it could be used. This is not the case with an open-source project lifecycle. The product you develop is open to the community to use, inspect and improve upon. This helps accelerate the development of the idea or product by allowing open-innovation to take place.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="dismissing-the-current-arguments-against-open-source-development">Dismissing the current arguments against open-source development<a href="#dismissing-the-current-arguments-against-open-source-development" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Dismissing the current arguments against open-source development" title="Direct link to Dismissing the current arguments against open-source development">​</a></h2><p>Can people take your code and use it for their own projects? The answer is yes, but this is not a bad thing at all. This is one of the things that empowers your idea by allowing you to see the improvements they made and how they made them, then adding those improvements into your code base.</p><p>Can people alter your code to include malicious code? This depends on how well you manage the pull requests for your code, as even the Linux Kernel has had some bad-actors try and slip in malicious code before, and it was caught by the community. So you just need to make sure you define a strict set of rules for your project maintainers to follow when it comes to merging pull-requests from the community into your code base.</p><p>Can you make money off Open-Source code? The answer to this is yes, and in many ways. It all comes down to how you design your project and the licensing you choose for it. As many open-source licenses do allow licensing, and support contracts, and many more options can be written into the standard licensing agreements.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-have-we-leveraged-open-source-for-businesses">How have we leveraged open-source for businesses?<a href="#how-have-we-leveraged-open-source-for-businesses" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How have we leveraged open-source for businesses?" title="Direct link to How have we leveraged open-source for businesses?">​</a></h2><p>As a consumer, you get to use the products of our work in open-source by testing our work (Bliss OS, Waydroid, Android-x86) on your laptop, tablet, desktop, server, etc. at no cost.
As a business, our projects are limited in use, but can be licensed for inclusion into a project, and we offer development contracts to help businesses further develop their products, with our projects included. We have also created toolkits for businesses to use for free in the past, demonstrating the power of rapid-prototyping through the use of our services.</p><p>For other businesses, not used to working in open-source, there will always be hesitations. But that doesn't mean we can't make it work. We have had some restraints on projects in the past, and the solution for those proprietary constraints is typically to build a system that can handle allowing the end user to use it, while keeping all the private bits, private still. A perfect example of this is how Google Play, Widevine, libndk-translation, Houdini, and other private blobs are included in our projects. We have even gone one step further in this where allowed, and produced tools for the rest of the open-source community to use, that allows them to benefit from using the proprietary blobs, while keeping the businesses private intents intact.</p><p>It really all comes down to the mental attitude behind your innovation, and all in how you spin it. It's about time the market starts thinking on reasons why they should start going open-source, and not looking for all the reasons why they shouldn't.</p>]]></content:encoded>
